                  Release of version 1.13 of Getopt::Declare
==============================================================================


Getopt::Declare is *yet another* command-line argument parser, one which
is specifically designed to be powerful but exceptionally easy to use.

To parse the command-line in `@ARGV', one simply creates a
Getopt::Declare object, by passing `Getopt::Declare::new()' a
specification of the various parameters that may be encountered:

    $args = new Getopt::Declare($specification);

The specification is a single string such as this:

    $specification = q(

	    -a              Process all data

	    -b <N:n>        Set mean byte length threshold to <N>
				    { bytelen = $N; }

	    +c <FILE>       Create new file <FILE>

	    --del           Delete old file
				    { delold() }

	    delete          [ditto]

	    e <H:i>x<W:i>   Expand image to height <H> and width <W>
				    { expand($H,$W); }

	    -F <file>...    Process named file(s)
				    { defer {for (@file) {process()}} }

	    =getrand [<N>]  Get a random number
			    (or, optionally, <N> of them)
				    { $N = 1 unless defined $N; }

	    --              Traditionally indicates end of arguments
				    { finish }
    );

in which the syntax of each parameter is declared, along with a
description and (optionally) one or more actions to be performed when
the parameter is encountered. The specification string may also include
other usage formatting information (such as group headings or
separators) as well as standard Perl comments (which are ignored).

Calling Getopt::Delare::new() parses the contents of the array
@ARGV, extracting any arguments which match the parameters defined in
the specification string, and storing the parsed values as hash elements
within the new Getopt::Declare object being created.

Other features of the Getopt::Declare package include:

        * The use of full Perl regular expressions to constrain
          matching of parameter components.

        * Automatic generation of error, usage and version information.

        * Optional conditional execution of embedded actions (i.e. only
          on successful parsing of the entire command-line)

        * Strict or non-strict parsing (unrecognized command-line
          elements may either trigger an error or may simply be left in
          @ARGV)

        * Declarative specification of various inter-parameter
          relationships (for example, two parameters may be declared
          mutually exclusive and this relationship will then be
          automatically enforced).

        * Intelligent clustering of adjacent flags (for example: the
          command-line sequence "-a -b -c" may be abbreviated to
          "-abc", unless there is also a `-abc' flag declared).

        * Selective or global case-insensitivity of parameters.

        * The ability to parse files (especially configuration files)
          instead of the command-line.

Note: requires the Text::Balanced module
