Revision history for Perl extension Getopt::Declare.

1.03	Thu Apr 30 19:51:27 1998

	- first semi-public release


1.04	Wed Jun 17 14:37:22 1998

	- Extended -AWK grammar to recognize <var>=''

	- Fixed code generator so that actions actually do
	  execute in the caller's package, as documented.

	- Changed 1st arg type of finish and reject to 
	  simple scalar. Made arg optional (omitted -> true)

	- Fixed handling of defer, reject and finish so that
	  they work as expected


1.05	Thu Aug 27 16:35:26 1998

	- Added code to reset $_VAL_ each time a parameter matches

	- Added a test.pl


1.06	Mon Nov  2 06:21:38 1998

	- Made detection of strictness more robust (in line with
	  change (bug?) in list construction behaviour in 5.005_02)

	- Added workarounds for weird behaviour of pod2man


1.07	Tue Mar 23 16:25:20 1999

	- Changed behaviour of [ditto] when ditto'ing multiline
	  descriptions (now prints: "Same as <prevflag>" instead)

	- Fixed bug in handling of version flag (which made every
	  argument beginning with -v... into a version flag)

	- Shifted all internal entries of the Getopt::Declare hash
	  into an anonymous hash in the entry "_internal".

	- Patched the Makefile.PL to note dependencies (thanks Roland)

	- Altered parsing of [strict] so that it's ignored when 
	  commented out.


1.08	Fri May 21 06:17:04 1999

	- Now only generates .CODE file if $::Declare_debug is true

	- Added Text::Balanced as PREREQ to Makefile.PL

	- Moved mutex test earlier in parameter parsing to
	  correct an error that caused mutexing to be ignored
	  (thanks Eric)

	- Fixed hanging when last line was non-NL-terminated
	  (thanks David)
